          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who we are</h2>
          <p class="lead">Founded in 2009, by designers Ben Wright and Paul Stafford, DesignStudio is a global brand and design agency with offices in the creative hubs of London and San Francisco.</p><p class="lead">
Ben and Paul opened the agency after spotting a split in the creative industry. Studios were either boutique and beautiful, but only managing to work on a few projects or of a massive scale and impersonal with their client relationships. DesignStudio was created with the aim to fill this gap – delivering the quality of boutique, bespoke design to global brands and audiences.</p>
